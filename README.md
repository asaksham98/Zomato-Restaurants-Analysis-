# Zomato-Restaurants-Analysis-

Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all type of cuisines here. 
Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks, Buffet, Desserts you name it, and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is best place for foodies. The number of restaurants is increasing day 
by day.Currently which stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such a high number of restaurants. This industry has not been saturated yet. And new restaurants are 
opening every day. However, it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them 
include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and overlicensing. This Zomato data aims at analysing demography 
of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding 
similarity between neighbourhoods of Bengaluru based on food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating 
for the place.

Justification of the Project

The basic idea of analysing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places in 
Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With 
each day new restaurants opening the industry has not been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. Despite increasing demand, it however has become difficult for 
new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly 
on the restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography 
of a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality? Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food. If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of 
people for e.g., Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are mostly vegetarian. This kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as: Location of the 
restaurant, Approx. Price of food, Theme based restaurant or not, which locality of that city serves those cuisines with maximum number of restaurants? The needs of people 
who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighbourhood and Is a particular neighbourhood famous for its own kind of food? “Just so that you have a good meal the next 
time you step out”. The data is accurate to that available on the Zomato website until 15 March 2019.

Advantage of the Analysis

With this implementation it is possible to deliver useful information for Business areas and also for Zomato customers on choosing the best restaurant for ordering 
(especially the new ones). This is an example of what predictive models can do in practice. Data analysis is important in business to understand problems facing an 
organisation, and to explore data in meaningful ways. Data is merely facts and figures. Data analysis organises, interprets, structures, and presents the data into 
useful information that provides context for the data. This context can then be used by decision-makers to act with the aim of enhancing productivity and business gain.
